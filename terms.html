                                                then you may not be able to take advantage of
                                                some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what

                                                2.7 We also collect, use, and share Aggregated Data such as statistical
                                                or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated
                                                Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered
                                                personal data in law as this data does not directly or
                                                indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your

                                                accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect
                                                Aggregated Data with your personal data so that
                                                it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data
                                                as personal data which will be used in accordance
                                                with this Privacy Policy.<br>

                                                2.8 We do not ordinarily collect any Special Categories of Personal Data
                                                about you (this includes details about your
                                                race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual
                                                orientation, political opinions, trade union

                                                data). Nor do we collect any information about
                                                criminal convictions and offenses. If you use any of these types of
                                                personal data when using any of the Website’s
                                                features (including the messaging system), we will not be able to tell.
                                                We will treat all the personal data as ordinary
                                                personal data according to this Privacy Policy.</p>

                                                collecting information in connection with a website.
                                                For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally
